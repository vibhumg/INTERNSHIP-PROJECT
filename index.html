                Most Indians express a great deal through their clothing. Their quench for the ultimate perfection plays
                a
                great deal in their choice of beautifully colored dramatic and sensuous garments. Highly lively colors
                woven
                in to signify the ornate designs can be found resonating through the whole of India. Lot of western
                influences has created modern designs which has been included into the basic structure of Indian outfit
                and
                that are the dresses that we find these days. So that makes us wonder, what was Indian fashion actually
                like
                when there were no designers displaying their haute couture to pamper a luxurious line of clientele?
                Well
                the answer to it is, India had its own kind of customs and traditions followed from generation to
                generations, the presence of it are even felt today. A surprising fact about ancient Indian fashion was
                that
                the clothes were not stitched together at all because most of the clothing was ready-to-wear, as soon as
                they left the loom.
